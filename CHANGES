V1.0.0
--------------
Initial Release
	This program opens access logs, processes them into client csvs, working on timeblocks of 15 mins. 
	If it cannot find an access log it will wait a config time(currently 1 sec) and retry it, before ignoreing and moveing to the next file.
	If it cannot find any file it presumes it is live and sleeps a config time(currently 5 mins) then retries. After finishing a block it rotates to the next timeblock

	In the event of a crash the program will leave a PID file in the working dir detailing the PID and the working TIMEBLOCK. 
	It should be restarted given the seed time of the next timeblock. ie 1745. When 0000 is the seed it removes the csvs for the process day before starting. 
	This program runs live and is cronned by user root.

	<usage>
	./sort config/sort.conf <date> <seed>

	See ./sort -h for details

V1.0.1
Added.
- 1. done flag file
- 2. Added UT cases for CSVLineBase
- 3. Empty field workaround

- 1. done flag file
	Signal the inserts process accross the nfs mount that the process has completed for the day.
	Create a file sort_done_<date>.csv in the csv directory
	This was necessary for compatibility with the current V3 implementation	
- 2. UT for split function
- 3. Empty field workaround
	Replace the "-" empty field char in Logs with a blank fielda in generated CSV

V1.0.2
Fix.
- 1. XOR cookies 

- 1. XOR cookies 
	Stack Collecion servers generate a unique 32 char string for user / session cookies only unique in 32 char entirity. 
	We use chars [1-16], as this was acceptable to be unique when BM Collection uses md5. The resulting bug in this case was a high rate 
	of cookie collision (approx 400%). As a workaround tests showed that XOR first and second half of cookies generated a unique 16 char int which we 
	convert to HEX.
